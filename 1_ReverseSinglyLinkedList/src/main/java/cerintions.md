# Problem 1: Reverse a Singly Linked List

## Problem Statement:
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return the reversed linked list.

## Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`.

## Example:
### Input:

head = [1,2,3,4,5]

### Output:

[5,4,3,2,1]
